# Rational infinite-precision dual solutions to the Fractional Bin Packing Problem (FBPP)

This page contains the companion material to the paper entitled "Infinite-Precision Pattern-Enumeration Techniques for Bin Packing Problems" by R. Baldacci, S. Coniglio, , J.F. Cordeau, and F. Furini. It contains certified dual solutions to the linear-programming relaxation of the set-partitioning formulation of the Bin Packing Problem (BPP) for the following Augmeneted Non-IRUP (ANI) instances:
