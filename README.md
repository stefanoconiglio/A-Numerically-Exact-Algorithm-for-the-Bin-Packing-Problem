# Rational infinite-precision dual solutions to the Fractional Bin Packing Problem (FBPP)

This page contains the companion material to the paper entitled "Infinite-Precision Pattern-Enumeration Techniques for Bin Packing Problems" by R. Baldacci, S. Coniglio, , J.F. Cordeau, and F. Furini. It contains certified dual solutions to the linear-programming relaxation of the set-partitioning formulation of the Bin Packing Problem (BPP) for Augmeneted Non-IRUP (ANI) instances.

In the following, we report the names of the instances for which a certified dual solution has been found, the number of columns (patterns) generated by the extended-precision LP solver (SOPLEX) and its computing time  (in seconds).

- all 50 instances with 201 items and all 50 instances with 402 items (also see 201-402.txt)
