# Rational infinite-precision dual solutions to the Fractional Bin Packing Problem (FBPP)

This page contains the online material to the paper entitled "Infinite-Precision Pattern-Enumeration Techniques for Bin Packing Problems" by R. Baldacci, S. Coniglio, , J.F. Cordeau, and F. Furini. It reports certified dual solutions to the linear-programming (LP) relaxation of the set-partitioning formulation of the Bin Packing Problem  (BPP)---to so-called Fractional Bin Packing Problem (FBPP)---for the instances of the Augmeneted Non-IRUP (ANI) class.

In the following, we report the names of the instances for which a certified dual solution has been found, the number of columns (patterns) generated by the extended-precision LP solver (SOPLEX) and its computing time (in seconds). We solve a total of:
- 50/50 instances with 201 items
- 50/50 instances with 402 items
- 50/50 instances with 600 items
- 24/50 instances with 801 items
- 15/50 instances with 1002 items.

The results are obtained by setting:
- K1 = 1E-13 (K1  corresponds to the precision that is used in the label-setting algorithm that solves the pricing problem as well as in the solver---SOPLEX---that is used for reoptimizing each LP relaxation)
- K2 = 1E-03 for the instances with 201, 402, and 800 items and K2 = 1E-05 for the instances with 600 and 1002 items (K2 coincides with the reduced cost value after which the code swithces from using Gurobi as LP solver to SOPLEX)
